# RedPitaya-Dual-Channel-Data-Logger-Plotter-Tkinter-SCPI-Acquire-Save-to-Excel-
This project is a Python desktop GUI built with **Tkinter** that connects to a **Red Pitaya (SCPI over TCP socket)** (or a compatible SCPI device), acquires waveform data from **two channels**, saves the data to **Excel (.xlsx)**, plots the signals using **Matplotlib**, and also plots the **difference** between channel 1 and channel 2.
